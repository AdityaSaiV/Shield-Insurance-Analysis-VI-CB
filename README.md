# Shield-Insurance-Analysis-VI-CB

🛡️ Shield Insurance PowerBI Dashboard 📊

Welcome to my Shield Insurance Company Analysis project, crafted as part of the #CodebasicsVirtualInternship! 🚀 This interactive PowerBI dashboard transforms raw data into actionable insights, empowering Shield Insurance to secure a brighter future through data-driven decisions. Built with precision and creativity, this project showcases my expertise in PowerBI, data modeling, and storytelling.

🌟 Project Overview

Shield Insurance, a fictional company for the Codebasics internship, aims to optimize its operations by analyzing customer and revenue trends. I developed a 3-page PowerBI dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs), segment customers, and uncover strategic opportunities across cities, age groups, and sales channels.

🎯 Objectives

📈 Track Core Metrics: Display total customers, revenue, daily customer growth, and daily revenue growth.  
📅 Monitor Trends: Show month-over-month (MoM) percentage changes with switchable revenue/customer trend graphs.  
🌍 Segment Data: Break down revenue and customers by age group and city to identify profitable demographics.  
🔍 Analyze Sales Modes: Create a dedicated page for sales mode analysis (offline agents, app, direct, website).  
👥 Dive into Age Groups: Develop a page for age group preferences, policies, and expected settlements.  
⚙️ Enable Filters: Provide dynamic filters for sales mode, age group, city, month, and policy ID.

🛠️ Tools & Skills

PowerBI: Data modeling, DAX, interactive visualizations.  
Excel: Data preprocessing and validation.  
Python/MySQL: Supporting data analysis (if applicable).  
Data Storytelling: Translating insights into actionable strategies.

📊 Key Insights

💰 Revenue Trends: Total revenue of ₹989M, with March 2023 as the peak and November 2022 as the lowest, indicating seasonal variability.  
👥 Customer Growth: The 31–40 age group leads with 4,361 customers in March 2023, followed by 41–50 with 2,100 in April 2023. Younger groups (18–24, 25–30) remain stable but lower.  
🌆 Geographic Performance: Delhi NCR dominates revenue and customer share, while tier-2 cities show potential for growth.  
🛒 Sales Channels: Offline agents drive 55% of customers and significant revenue, while online channels (app, website) need optimization.  
📜 Policy Preferences: POL2005HEL is a top revenue driver; younger groups prefer affordable policies like POL4321HEL.

💡 Recommendations

🚀 Combat Seasonal Dips: Launch early-year campaigns (January/February) to stabilize revenue and customer drops (e.g., November 2022).  
🎯 Target 31–40 Age Group: Focus on this segment with premium policies and loyalty programs for maximum revenue.  
📱 Enhance Digital Channels: Improve app/website UX with mobile-friendly, gamified features to boost online revenue.  
🤝 Strengthen Agents: Invest in agent training to sustain high-value sales, especially for 31–50 age groups.  
🔄 Optimize Policies: Promote POL2005HEL with bundled offers; streamline claims for 18–24 to improve settlement rates.
